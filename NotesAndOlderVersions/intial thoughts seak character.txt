the idea of pasting in a white space version of the text won't work since it lose's my cursors position


I could help my program by at least being in the same line as the character I want to find.
It should find the first occurance before or after depending on what I tell it.

to so this we can do shift end (or home) and then find the first (or last) occurance within that copied snippet.
Nicely we can repeat this to go forward (or back) one more as our copied field will newly not include the current found character. 
(build this in have to think about which character to ignore depending on the direction, but also where to place the cursor)

maybe I can actually trick the program into putting my cursor on the right character if I can paste the front and back of the line

yeah so paste the second half, then home, then paste the first half (including the character to find) and cursor will be right in front.

;press key combo
;wait maybe 3-5 seconds for the user input of search character (not too short to miss the chance but don't lock out the user for too long either)

;send shift home or shift end
;copy to clipboard

;search within that string
;ignoring either the first or last character within that search

;if not found do nothing - finish script

;if found
;delete highlighted text

;split the string into two paHomerts based on the found character
;(retain found character at end of first string)

;paste second string
;send home

;paste first string
;done script


;..... actually pasting order is more difficult if we are searching forward

for forward, we need to keep the head of the string,

then we do our search to split the tail of the string

then we add the head to the first part of the tail so we have only two strings

then we do the pasting order again, second part, home, first part (which is head plus first part of tail including the found character)


ideas for key combo

I could do double alt, but that could lead to errors

alt gr seems good (accept I don['t think it's on every keyboard)


to distinguish direction I could use shift with the letter to do the search.
Captial letter means search ... forwards
usually I will notice a mistake after writing it so I want to jump back more often




Now I have to test this with some refal text f so I can be sure it's not fucking things up
