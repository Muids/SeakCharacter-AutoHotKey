multi search
----------------


get into a locked state (again with a few second expxiry window)
where if you keep pressing the same search character (or itself with shift)
then you cycle through the characters backwards or forwards

using only the same letter (and breaking if another letter is hit) 
makes sense because if I want to fix a typoed letter than I won't be replacing it with itself

...but actually sometimes I miss a double letter
or maybe I would want to capitalize or uncapitalise


aha! why not just press the hot ket alt gr again to repeat search, no need for the character
(and shift alt gr for forwards)

----------------
multi search - Problems
----------------
Alt Gr is all kinds of crazy on my keyboard, it is already two keys, Lctrl+RAlt and authotkey doesn't do triple combos

so I could do alt gr to enter the search state ... and then the letter to search, no remember that's bad because we want free typing


how about just Rctrl or Shift+ Rctrl. at least I can modify that

it would be cool if the search didn't just fail if we looked in the wrong direction but instead wrapped, 
so we still end up in the search state

----------------
multi search - Solution
----------------
this method is an addaption of the cctrl + arrow key method so it makes sense to use a realted key combo

clicking ctrl on it's own could start the search state, then click a letter (it could auto go back to the previous letter)
and then you get a time window to press left or right and it will naviagte to other instances of the initaially chosen letter

you can break from the search by clicking any other key


----------------
wrap line
----------------

you could have if wrap around the line too (nice but would actually take a lot more logic)


----------------
multi line
----------------

obviously it would be cool to have this be multi line but again it's a lot more work
