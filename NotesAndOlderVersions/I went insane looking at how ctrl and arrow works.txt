behaviour of special symbols is different to white space, white space is skipped but catches
sdfasdf£dfgsfgsf$dfgsdfgdsdg sdfdsfgdf
these symbols are not skipped and catch

so quotes somehow ignore the power of symbols stopping shit

sdfas!sdfsdfsdf
sdfsdf?sdfsdf

and some symbols do act like whit space, they stop but are skipped  like ? and !

sdfsdf.asdfasdf (. acts like a charcter)


dsdfs".dfsdfgd (no effect)

sfgsdfgdsf"?sdfsdf

sfdfdfg"!sddfsdf

" turns ? ! ino behaving like an unquoted symbol

asdfasdf'£sdsdfsdfs ' seems to work the same as "

sdfsdfs%$(£sdfsdf  (maybe stop before symbols get turned into their own type of block)

wtf is % doing? it seems to be a stop before and after
